Depression is a prevalent mental health issue among university students, with significant
implications for their overall well-being and academic success. This research focuses on
predicting depression among university students in Bangladesh. A dataset of 505 survey
responses collected from students across various universities in Bangladesh was utilized for
analysis. The study employed a range of machine learning algorithms, including Decision
Trees, Random forests, Support Vector Machines (SVM), AdaBoost Classifier, Gaussian
Naive Bayes, XG Boost Classifier, Logistic Regression, and kNN Classification.
Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate
the effectiveness of the models. Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Random Forest
Classification were used to select optimal features or reasons associated with depression and
eliminate irrelevant factors. The results demonstrated that the Logistic Regression and SVM
algorithm achieved the highest accuracy rate of 93.1% and an F1 score of 92.9%, indicating
its effectiveness in predicting depression among university students. Several key factors were
identified as significant predictors of depression, including academic stress, social support.
The findings of this study provide valuable insights into the prediction of depression among
university students in Bangladesh using machine learning approaches. Overall, this research
underscores the potential of machine learning techniques in identifying and predicting
depression among university students
